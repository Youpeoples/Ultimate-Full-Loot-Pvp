# Ultimate Full Loot Pvp Script
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b63cce31-c911-414f-9a30-c88727b19da0)

Transform every open-world PvP kill into a dynamic ‚Äòspoils of war‚Äô encounter. Victims‚Äô gear and gold are instantly pulled into free-for-all loot chests around their corpse. No core edits required. Configure global defaults for drop rates, quality filters, despawn timers, and gold splits, then dial in per-zone overrides for surgical control over your world-PvP loot experience.

---

## Key Features
* **Multi-chest logic** ‚Äì up to 16 items per chest, unlimited overflow.
  
* **Gold cuts & caps** ‚Äì percent roll, optional hard cap, and even splitting across chests.
  
* **Granular filters** ‚Äì map/zone allow- & block-lists, level gates, spirit-healer range checks, Battleground ignore, and resurrection-sickness skip.
  
* **Fine-grained item rules** ‚Äì drop only what you want (quality, BoP, quest, consumables, reagents, profession-bag contents, vendor value, item-level, stack size, explicit allow/deny lists).
  
* **Equipped & bag scanning** ‚Äì includes equipped slots, backpack, and extra bags; bank support planned.
  
* **Simple config file** ‚Äì all behaviour lives in one `CFG` table at the top of the script.
  
* **Per‚Äêzone overrides** ‚Äì Maintain a single default configuration while customizing behavior (despawn timers, quality filters, gold cuts, etc.) on a per-zone basis.
  
* **Per-area overrides** ‚Äì Want even more control? Keep a single default setup, tweak per-zone overrides, then go deeper by configuring each individual area inside a zone. Letting every sub-region behave exactly the way you want.
  
* **Full DEBUG mode** ‚Äì verbose console output for every step.

## How It Works
1. **Kill detection** ‚Äì `ON_KILL_PLAYER` event fires.  
2. **Safety checks** ‚Äì level, map/zone, Battleground, spirit healer range, etc.  
3. **Inventory sweep** ‚Äì equipped slots ‚Üí backpack ‚Üí extra bags.  
4. **Item & gold selection** ‚Äì filtered list shuffled; gold % rolled & capped.  
5. **Chest spawn** ‚Äì chests arranged in a circle around the corpse.  
6. **Looting** ‚Äì any player can loot.
7. **Gold** - configurable to drop from a single chest or split across all chests.

DEBUG mode echoes every action, GUID, and item removed to the server console for painless troubleshooting.

## Roadmap
* **Bank & guild-bank scanning** (disabled for safety by default).
